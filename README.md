# game.tiiki

This repository contains a minimal React + TypeScript prototype for a stamina-based battle game.

## Development

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The React app now includes multiple screens:
- `Menu` (`/`) for navigation
- `Game` (`/battle`) for battles
- `Inventory` (`/inventory`) for weapon selection
